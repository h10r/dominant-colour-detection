Tonks Classification Helper
==============

Description
--------------

Tonks Classification Helper is a tool to classify the colors of single images and folders with images. Tonks was written in Processing / Java. It allows users to save tags and color classification information for each image in a SQLite database, that can be integrated with other programming languages, e.g. Python and scikit-learn.
